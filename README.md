# Whale
Whale is a native iOS application for sending and receiving funding for projects. Unlike crowd-funding, Wh√§le allows for users to provide a micro-loan to another user, who pays back the loan within a given time span at a minimal interest rate. This is enforced through a connection between the recipient's credit card and their account info.
